# AMPAS_Solver_for_Dynamic_Traffic_Assignment
AMPAS (Active-set Mirror Projection with Adaptive Sampling) is a scalable algorithm for dynamic traffic assignment. It reduces projection cost from O(n log n) to O(k), with k the number of active paths, making it increasingly efficient as network size grows.
